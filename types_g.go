	_Grunnable // 1

	// _Grunning means this goroutine may execute user code. The
	// stack is owned by this goroutine. It is not on a run queue.
	// It is assigned an M and a P (g.m and g.m.p are valid).
	_Grunning // 2

	// _Gsyscall means this goroutine is executing a system call.
	// It is not executing user code. The stack is owned by this
	// goroutine. It is not on a run queue. It is assigned an M.
	_Gsyscall // 3

	// _Gwaiting means this goroutine is blocked in the runtime.
	// It is not executing user code. It is not on a run queue,
	// but should be recorded somewhere (e.g., a channel wait
	// queue) so it can be ready()d when necessary. The stack is
	// not owned *except* that a channel operation may read or
	// write parts of the stack under the appropriate channel
	// lock. Otherwise, it is not safe to access the stack after a
	// goroutine enters _Gwaiting (e.g., it may get moved).

	// _Gmoribund_unused is currently unused, but hardcoded in gdb
	// scripts.

	// _Gdead means this goroutine is currently unused. It may be
	// just exited, on a free list, or just being initialized. It
	// is not executing user code. It may or may not have a stack
	// allocated. The G and its stack (if any) are owned by the M
	// that is exiting the G or that obtained the G from the free
	// list.
	_Gdead // 6

	// _Genqueue_unused is currently unused.

	// is not executing user code and is not on a run queue. The
	// stack is owned by the goroutine that put it in _Gcopystack.

	// _Gpreempted means this goroutine stopped itself for a
	// suspendG preemption. It is like _Gwaiting, but nothing is
	// yet responsible for ready()ing it. Some suspendG must CAS
	// the status to _Gwaiting to take responsibility for
	// ready()ing this G.
	_Gpreempted // 9

	// _Gscan combined with one of the above states other than
	// _Grunning indicates that GC is scanning the stack. The
	// goroutine is not executing user code and the stack is owned
	// by the goroutine that set the _Gscan bit.
	//
	// _Gscanrunning is different: it is used to briefly block
	// state transitions while GC signals the G to scan its own
	// stack. This is otherwise like _Grunning.
	//
	// atomicstatus&~Gscan gives the state the goroutine will
	// return to when the scan completes.
